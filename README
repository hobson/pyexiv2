pyexiv2
*******

Welcome to pyexiv2, a Python binding to the excellent C++ library Exiv2
(http://www.exiv2.org/).

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.


Dependencies
============

pyexiv2 depends on the following libraries:

	* boost.python (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
	* exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)

Of course it needs a Python interpreter to run.

Optionally, you can use pygtk or pyqt to easily take advantage of the thumbnail
manipulation methods proposed by pyexiv2 to display those thumbnails.

Building and installing
=======================

You will need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to build and install the library.
To do so, while in the top-level directory (e.g. '/home/johndoe/pyexiv2', which
should contain a file named 'SConstruct'), run the following commands:

	$ scons
	$ scons install # as administrator, e.g. `sudo scons install`

The result of the build is a dynamic library, libpyexiv2.so, that is a Python
module called libpyexiv2. This module is a low-level binding. It is in turn used
in a higher level module, pyexiv2.
The install command installs the two modules in your site-specific directory for
Python modules (e.g. '/usr/lib/python2.4/' under Linux).

To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply include the following line:

	import pyexiv2

It provides a single class, pyexiv2.Image, with all convenient methods for the
manipulation of EXIF and IPTC metadata.
