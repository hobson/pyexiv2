pyexiv2
*******

Welcome to pyexiv2, a Python binding to the excellent C++ library Exiv2
(http://www.exiv2.org/).

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.


Dependencies
============

pyexiv2 depends on the following libraries:

	* boost.python (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
	* exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)

Of course it needs a Python interpreter to run.


Building and using
=======================

You will need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to build the library.
To do so, simply cd to the src directory, and run scons:

	$ scons

The result is a dynamic library, libpyexiv2.so, that is a Python module called
libpyexiv2. This module is a low-level binding. It is in turn used in a higher
level module, pyexiv2.

To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply include the following line:

	import pyexiv2

It provides a single class, pyexiv2.Image, with all convenient methods for the
manipulation of EXIF and IPTC metadata.
