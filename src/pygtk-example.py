	Example of how to combine pygtk and pyexiv2 to display thumbnail data.

	Minimalistic example of how to load and display with pygtk the thumbnail
	data extracted from an image using the method Image.getThumbnailData().
	The path to the image file from which the thumbnail data should be extracted
	should be passed as the only argument of the script.

	It is of course assumed that you have pygtk installed.
