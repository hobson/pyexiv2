- The constructor of the Image class should accept a filename OR a buffered stream
- Reimplement copyMetadataTo in C++
- Unit test the C++ wrapper (in python, if possible)
- Use logging to log, among other things, decoding and type conversion errors
- Tag getters/setters should support unicode strings as well as regular strings (see bug #146313).
- What about forcing all strings encoding to UTF in tag values? (see Marc's mail)
- Reflect changes from src/error.cpp in libexiv2 to src/libpyexiv2.cpp: new error messages, error codes changed
- Add a 'doc' builder to the SConstruct to build the module's documentation
- Export docstrings for the C++ binding
- Rewrite the exiv2 command-line tool and the test binaries in Python and (Python) scripts to run the same tests that are run to test exiv2
- Write a complete documentation for the binding and its uses (use other tools, maybe pydoctor)
- New architecture and support of XMP metadata (see bug #183337)
- Consider upgrading the license to GPL v3
