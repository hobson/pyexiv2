todo list

- Fix the issue when changing one value inside a list returned by image[key]: the value is changed in the internal dictionnary but no call to setIptcTagValue() is performed -> use tuples instead of lists, tuples are immutables
- Disable the get...() and set...() methods (by making them private) -> metadata is accessible only through the dictionnary metaphor
- Rewrite the exiv2 command-line tool and the test binaries in Python and (Python) scripts to run the same tests that are run to test exiv2
- Rewrite the docstring documentation of the module using epydoc's syntax (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-fields.html)
- Write a complete documentation for the binding and it uses
- Write unit tests (http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html)
- Use pkgconfig with scons in order to check the dependencies before compiling (http://www.scons.org/wiki/UsingPkgConfig)
