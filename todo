- Investigate on how the IPTC date and time formats are handled by exiv2: it
   seems that they use an specific internal format (that would be, namely,
   '%Y-%m-%d' and '%H:%M:%S[Â±%H:%M]'). It would, in a way, make the parsing of
   dates and times much simpler.
- High-level (Python types) IPTC tags handling: implement method
   setIptcTagValue().
- Add extensive unit tests.
- Document the binding.
